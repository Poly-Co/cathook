# Cathook x64
We have privated our cathook fork to prevent manual bans from Valve, and will add multiple evasion technologies to prevent future bans. 

Our fork is now a member-only fork, that means you would have to gain access to the fork as a member since we update part of our code to prevent VAC to catching us.
